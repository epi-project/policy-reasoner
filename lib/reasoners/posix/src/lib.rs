//  Description:
//! A policy reasoner implementation based on POSIX file permissions.
//!
//! This documentation is aimed at developers that want to maintain or extend the POSIX reasoner. High level
//! documentation for users of the POSIX reasoner can be found in the [Brane user
//! guide](https://wiki.enablingpersonalizedinterventions.nl/user-guide/). An explanation of the POSIX policy file can
//! also be found there.
//!
//! # Goal
//!
//! This policy reasoner is meant to be easy and widely applicable. The aim is to take few assumptions and require as
//! little configuration as possible, allowing this reasoner to function as an easy to deploy proof of concept. This
//! allows users of Brane to gather experience with the abstract concept of a policy reasoner, before one has to start
//! writing policies themselves.
//!
//! Additionally, it could function well as an initial reasoner as a user adopts Brane on their systems, since it could
//! use permissions already set on their current systems to infer which users have access to what data.
//!
//! # Design
//!
//! To describe the design of this policy reasoner, we will walk through both the setup and usage of the reasoner from a
//! high level point of view.
//!
//! First, it checks the `DATA_INDEX` environment variable or the .env file for the location of the data index. We
//! imagine this points towards a mounted distributed file system like NFS. Then, it scans the directories for data
//! index files. From these files a [DataIndex] is created which is passed on to the [PosixReasonerConnector].
//!
//! Now that the [PosixReasonerConnector] is created, it can start to handle requests. There are three types of
//! requests:
//!
//! - [Execute task](fn@PosixReasonerConnector::execute_task)
//! - [Access data](fn@PosixReasonerConnector::access_data_request)
//! - [Workflow validation](fn@PosixReasonerConnector::workflow_validation_request)
//!
//! As of now, the assumption is taken that it does not matter for this reasoner which type of request comes in, as we
//! only look at the data usage in the [Workflow].
//!
//! As one of these requests comes in, the provided [Workflow] is parsed using a [DatasetCollectorVisitor] (an
//! implementation of the new util trait [WorkflowVisitor]) and all data accesses in the workflow are gathered and
//! associated with an access type of either read, write, or execute (execute is currently unused as no usage was
//! found).
//!
//! From this point, we iterate over all the different datasets and associated requests/required permissions. For each
//! [Dataset] we look up the path in the [DataIndex]. Now that we have the path and the requested permissions, we can
//! check if the user in the mapping has access to this dataset.
//!
//! ### Current permission model
//!
//! The current permission model is based on the POSIX file permissions. This means that we check if the user has the
//! required permissions on the file. This is done by checking the file permissions of the file itself, and checking if
//! the user is either the owner of the file, in the group of the file, or if the file is world readable. The uid and
//! the gids extracted from the policy are matched against the file's uid and gid. If the file is owned by the user, the
//! owner permissions are checked. If the file is owned by a group the user is in, the group permissions are checked. If
//! neither of these is true, the other permissions are checked. If the user has the required permissions, the request is
//! approved. If not, the request is denied : [satisfies_posix_permissions].
//!
//!
//! # State of the implementation
//!
//! Right now, the POSIX policy reasoner works. One can submit workflow requests using a HTTP request, or one can use
//! the Policy Reasoner GUI to submit a workflow request to the policy reasoner. The policy reasoner will then evaluate
//! if all files are properly accessible and return a verdict.
//!
//! ## Limitations
//!
//! We had to draw a line in the sand for the current implementation, after which we considered additional details or
//! features out of the scope for the current project. If more time would have been available, there would have been a
//! fair bit of additional features that we would have liked to have implemented.
//!
//! The main origin of this line is the lack of an actual implementation inside Brane. To fully understand the
//! implications of the POSIX file permissions scheme, we need to start using the current implementation in a staging
//! environment. We should investigate the effects of multiple sites with many datasets. However, right now it is not
//! possible (or so we have been told) to mount the network shares to the reasoner container.
//!
//! Right now, this implementation is limited by the fact that it will try to load a single data index from the
//! `DATA_INDEX` environment variable. However, once we start mounting multiple network shares, we imagine that it might
//! be nice to be able to load multiple data indices.
//!
//! Another limitation is that the current implementation is not fully POSIX compliant. We still need to figure out how
//! some of the POSIX permission behaviours map into this emulation. E.g., right now we only check the file permissions
//! on the file itself, we do not check the permissions on the directory. Since we are going to be working with network
//! shares (and possible hard/symlinks) this becomes non-trivial, a working implementation is needed to investigate what
//! behaviour is desired. This is compounded by the problem that not only the user needs to be able to access the data,
//! but also the policy reasoner needs to reach at least the directory in which the file resides in order for the
//! reasoner to be able to `stat(1)` the file.
//!
//! Right now, we are seemingly limited by the fact that the policy reasoner GUI does not send at which site a [Dataset]
//! is accessed, making it impossible to fully know which of the mappings in the policy to use. There is a location
//! field that could be used, but since it is always set to `None`, we opted to fall back to the assumed location as
//! hardcoded in the static: [`ASSUMED_LOCATION`]
//!
//! # Future work
//!
//! - Support file creation: This requires us to look at the permissions of the parent directory of the potential
//! dataset, but this might be tricky considering the fact that the policy reasoner also needs to be able to access the
//! directory in order to check the file permissions.
//!
//! - Support multiple user mappings per location: Right now there is support in the code for multiple locations with
//! each their own user mapping, as different sites will often comprise of different network shares. But as it is
//! unclear right now how the volumes will be mounted on the reasoner container, it is hard to tell how such an
//! implementation is best designed.
//!
//! - Right now, this reasoner is both a module and a binary, but it should probably just be a binary. At this moment
//! however, documenting binaries is tricky in rust. As soon as we find a better solution, this documentation should be
//! moved to the binary itself. This might be useful in general, but particularly it is important to document reference
//! implementations.
//!
//! - LDAP / Active Directory support: Currently the Brane user to uid / gid mapping is embedded in the policy that is
//! loaded at the moment the reasoner is started. The idea of mapping users to uid and gids is not unique though, these
//! mappings can be sythesized from all sorts of resources. The most straightforward variant would be the loading of a
//! `passwd(5)` file, but since we are aiming at distributed file systems this would probably be of limited use. In
//! situations where file systems like NFS are often used, the users are store in Active Directory and accessed using
//! LDAP. Writing such an adapter to function as the user map seems so be a valuable addition to this reasoner, as this
//! would complete the picture of current existing systems and would allow a user of the reasoner to attach their
//! already existing and managed file systems with the correct access control. This would significantly reduce the
//! required investment of introducing policies in new Brane users.
//!
//! - ACL support: Besides regular POSIX file permissions, many file systems also support [POSIX
//! ACL](https://web.archive.org/web/20240210045229/https://www.usenix.org/legacy/publications/library/proceedings/usenix03/tech/freenix03/full_papers/gruenbacher/gruenbacher_html/main.html).
//! This would be an obvious and very useful extension to this reasoner. Usage of these ACLs is by far less common that
//! the regular POSIX permission it attempts to extend, but usage is also far from uncommon and potenial users of Brane,
//! and more specifically the policy reasoner, could have used these ACLs on their existing file systems.
//!
//! - The last point of future work is not specific to the POSIX reasoner, but more to the policy reasoner repository.
//! There is a desperate need for more elaborate documentation. We attempted to create a nice start with this reasoner,
//! but it can be quite daunting to figure out how every part of this system works. The author made a good effort to
//! improve the documentation during the running of this project, and that helped a lot. That combined with the already
//! existing implementation of the eFlint reasoner made this project possible. We hope that the POSIX (and
//! [no_op](crate::no_op)) reasoner can help guide future contributors in either extension of the current reasoners or
//! the addition of new reasoner types.
